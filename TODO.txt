#IN PROGRESS
-cleaning up a little bit

#TODO
save database if there is none, otherwise only update changes

figure out the best way for saving ratings in ID3 tags (the POPM frame is kinda complicated) - fake winamp/windows media player/Rhythmbox/...... ratings?
add option to config for that

write server code
connect to server, update database

run program in background/as a daemon and sync database every now and then
maybe monitor changes in a folder?

add option to automatically generate/update playlists by rating (according to user-defined rules)

(many little #TODO tasks in the code)

#DONE
save config to preferences file
load config file on start
add subparser to list/change configuration
